title: "Syringe Pump Project"
excerpt: "This project entails the construction of a functional syringe pump powered by a motor coupled to a lead screw. Key design considerations include adaptability to varying syringe diameters and adjustable flow rates. Additionally, the syringe pump incorporates status lights for operational feedback, a latching button for control, and a limit switch to halt motion when the plunger reaches its limit."

## Introduction 
Syringe pumps can be used in a variety of settings, from delivering medicine and nutrients to patients to delivering small volumes of liquid in research lab settings. In the medical setting, the fluid is delivered very slowly through a mechanism consisting of a motor turning a lead screw which moves the plunger forward and transfers fluid from the syringe to an IV tubing. The motorized and programmable setup enables the supply of fluid to be delivered continuously and consistently. The LCD reading on commercial syringe pumps allows the amount of fluid delivered to be monitored to a high degree of accuracy. Commercial syringe pumps are expensive, with entry-level models costing a couple of hundred to upper-echelon models in the thousands. Designing the individual parts of the syringe pump, 3-D printing them, and programming electronics can be a cost-effective alternative. 
The syringe pump consists of 3-D printed parts designed in Fusion 360. 3-D printing allows for both significantly lower cost and ease of access to make changes in the prototyping phase. The support structures that hold the syringe and the enclosure that holds the electronics were 3-D printed. The stepper motor on the outside is connected to the electronics and is programmable to alter the flow rate.
